Practice 1 - Generate 2 Models
	"Product": "ID", "Name", "CategoryID" (FK to Category)
	"Category": "ID", "Name"

Practice 2 - Generate a context called "ProductInfoContext"
	Foreign Keys and Seed Data are not required.
	Please collate the string fields.

Practice 3 - Implement the foreign key between product to category in the models and the context file. 

Practice 4 - Create a migration called "InitialMigration". Push it to the Database and confirm it in phpMyAdmin. Add Seed Data for both tables. Two categories, (2 categories, 5 products total minimum). Add a second (and potentially 3rd) migration and push those as well.
