Practice 1 - Generate 2 Models
	"Product": "ID", "Name", "CategoryID" (FK to Category)
	"Category": "ID", "Name"

Practice 2 - Generate a context called "ProductInfoContext"
	Foreign Keys and Seed Data are not required.
	Please collate the string fields.

Practice 3 - Implement the foreign key between product to category in the models and the context file. 

Practice 4 - Create a migration called "InitialMigration". Push it to the Database and confirm it in phpMyAdmin. Add Seed Data for both tables. Two categories, (2 categories, 5 products total minimum). Add a second (and potentially 3rd) migration and push those as well. 
	- Run "dotnet ef migrations add InitialMigration"
	- Run "dotnet ef database update"
	- Make updates, add seed data
	- Run "dotnet ef migrations add SeedData"
	- Run "dotnet ef database update"

Practice 5 - Create a scaffolded controller with views for the category model.
	- Right click on controllers
	- Select Add Controller
	- Select MVC Controller with Views, using Entity Framework

Practice 6 - Create an empty controller for product
	- Add an Action for Create and an action for List
	- Redirect the Index action to List.

Practice 7 - 
	- Create a view for each of List and Create (For product)
	- Add a GetProducts() method to the products controller that will retrieve products.
	- Render a list of all products in the list view
	- Add both of our views to the navigation.
